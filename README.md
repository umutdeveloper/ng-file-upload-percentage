## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To perform the file upload process, you need a back end. To quickly solve this requirement for testing purposes, you can download the sample repository from [Simple NodeJS Express File Upload](https://code-boxx.com/upload-files-nodejs-express/) and run it on port 3000 (`http://localhost:3000/`).

## Features

- The code has been primarily developed using RxJS.
- The current upload status is displayed on the screen.
- Success or error status is displayed on the screen.
- The upload button is not enabled when no file is selected or when the upload is not completed.
